# University Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for the clustering analysis of university data using K-Means and DB-scan algorithms. The dataset (`university_data.csv`) is analyzed in the Jupyter Notebook (`Analysis of university clustering.ipynb`). The clustering results are evaluated using various metrics, including homogeneity, completeness, V-measure, adjusted Rand index, adjusted mutual information, and silhouette coefficient.

## Files

- `university_data.csv`: Dataset containing university-related data for clustering analysis.
- `Analysis of university clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with code for K-Means and DB-scan clustering, and evaluation metrics.
- `data_summary.txt`: Description of the dataset.

## Instructions

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Review the `data_summary.txt` file for a description of the dataset (`university_data.csv`).

2. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Open `Analysis of university clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook for loading the dataset, performing K-Means and DB-scan clustering, and visualizing the results.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as homogeneity, completeness, V-measure, adjusted Rand index, adjusted mutual information, and silhouette coefficient. The code for evaluation is provided in the notebook.
